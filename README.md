File: README.md
This file contains the conditions and instructions required to run this program. 

**Purpose:**
This program is written to display the movement of a users’ head, left and right hand’s movement under VR environment by interpreting a user supplied CSV file in a standard format.
The main display is in 2D top down view, including replay speed control and a slider to track and change progress.
Supplementary displays are also offered to trace the movement of the three objects, as well as a simple 3D display.

**Required Environment: **
For the best performance, it is recommended to have the windows display scaling set to 100% on a 1080P screen. 
For the program to work, the following software/package need to be installed
*Python 3.7
*pip 19.0.3
The latest version of Python and pip can be downloaded here:

**Instructions:**
*After installed the above pre-requisites, the program can be launched by executing the Main.jar file. 
*To load the file, click the file button on the top right, multiple standard CSV files can be loaded via the prompted file explorer. 
*The top left scroll down menu allows the user to switch among the loaded files. 
*The name of the selected file is displayed at the centre address bar. 
*To begin playback, click the play button on the bottom left. 
*The drop-down menu controls the repay speed.
